    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This make-ahead quiche recipe is one of my all-time favorites! It can be frozen and baked later. My mother, who got this recipe from her friend Betty, used to make mass quantities and take them out whenever she needed one for an easy meal or hors d'oeuvre. She made it with light cream instead of milk.</p>
